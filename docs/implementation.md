# Faro Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 7, 2025  

## Overview

This document outlines the iterative implementation plan for Project Faro. Each iteration builds upon the previous one, adding new capabilities while maintaining a working system throughout development.

## Implementation Strategy

### **Iterative Development**
- Each iteration produces a working system
- Features are added incrementally
- Each iteration can be tested and validated
- Clear milestones and deliverables

### **Branch Strategy**
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- Feature branches: `feature/iteration-X-description`
- Release branches: `release/vX.Y.Z`

### **Git Tagging Strategy**
- `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`, etc. - Iteration releases
- `v1.0.0` - First production release
- `v1.1.0`, `v1.2.0` - Minor releases
- `v2.0.0` - Major releases
